## Credits

I have worked a few up my fellow students to collabrate and help each other, incudling Tim Lewis and Rebecca Feltman. 
I have also used google to make sure I was not missing any of my HTML elements and that they are in logical structure. 
The main webiste I used was: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp
